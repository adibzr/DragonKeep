Livestock vanish, buildings burn, and last night an entire hamlet disappeared. As the realm's most renowned adventurer, you've been summoned by the desperate Queen herself.The ancient Dragon's Keep has awakened, she tells you, her voice steady despite the fear in her eyes. The sacred Heartstone that sealed the dungeon for centuries has been stolen. Without it, the dragon Kaelindrath will break free to unleash devastation not seen for a thousand years. She presses a weathered map into your hands. Find the Heartstone within the Keep. Return it to its pedestal—or slay the dragon if you must. The thief was seen entering the dungeon three days ago. Armed with your trusty sword, a small torch, and the weight of a kingdom's survival on your shoulders, you stand before the ancient stone entrance of Dragon's Keep. Strange runes flicker with blue fire around the archway.\n\nThe heavy door creaks open at your touch, as if inviting you inside.",

At her side stands Lord Drezden, a regal figure with cold eyes, directing robed cultists who work around an altar positioned near the dragon's chest. A young man—presumably Kiran—is translating inscriptions on the chamber walls under duress. Near him stands a pedestal with a pulsing red crystal: the true Heartstone. They're preparing to extract her heart's blood while removing the Heartstone from her influence, Elara whispers. The dual shock will break the final seal.",

The other guardians perished in the final battle, but Kaelindrath survived, volunteering to maintain an eternal vigil. She traces ornate carvings on the walls depicting this history. The first king of Aldurath was a dragon-rider who fought alongside her. When she sacrificed part of her heart to create the Heartstone, he swore his bloodline would forever honor and support her watch. She looks sad. Over generations, fear replaced gratitude. The Keep became forbidden ground, and Kaelindrath became a monster in children's tales. Only the Order of Scale-Bearers remembered the truth, serving in secret.",
