## Story Structure Overview
- 10 main branches
- 5 paths leading to the dragon boss
- 2 paths leading to certain death
- 1 path looping back to the start
- 2 paths ending without slaying the dragon

## Starting Point: The Entrance

You stand before the ancient stone entrance of Dragon's Keep, a labyrinthine dungeon rumored to house untold treasures guarded by a fearsome dragon. Armed with only your wits, a rusty sword, and a small torch, you step into the darkness. The heavy door slams shut behind you.

### Choice 1: Which path do you take?
- **Left Corridor**: A narrow passage with flickering torches (Branch A)
- **Right Corridor**: A wider tunnel with strange markings on the walls (Branch B)
- **Central Staircase**: Stone steps descending into deeper darkness (Branch C)

## Branch A: Left Corridor

The narrow passage winds through the dungeon. You hear water dripping somewhere in the distance. After walking for several minutes, you encounter a wounded knight slumped against the wall.

### Choice A1: What do you do?
- **Help the knight**: You bandage his wounds with strips of cloth (Branch A1)
- **Ignore the knight**: You carefully step past him and continue on your way (Branch A2)

## Branch A1: Knight's Gratitude

The knight thanks you and offers his shield. "Take this," he whispers. "It's enchanted against dragon fire. Follow this passage to the end, and you'll find a hidden entrance to the dragon's lair."

### Choice A1-1: What now?
- **Take his advice**: Follow the passage to the end (LEADS TO BOSS PATH 1)
- **Ask about other routes**: The knight mentions a treasure room nearby (Branch A1-2)

## Branch A1-2: The Treasure Room

You discover a room filled with gold coins and jewels. As you reach for a particularly beautiful emerald, you trigger a trap! The floor gives way beneath you.

**LOOP PATH**: You fall through an elaborate tunnel system and somehow end up back at the entrance of the dungeon. (RETURNS TO START)

## Branch A2: Continued Journey

Ignoring the knight, you press forward into the darkness. The passage eventually opens into a large chamber with two doors.

### Choice A2-1: Which door do you choose?
- **Door with dragon carving**: (LEADS TO BOSS PATH 2)
- **Door with skull carving**: (Branch A2-2)

## Branch A2-2: The Poison Room

As you enter, you're greeted by an overpowering sweet smell. Too late, you realize the room is filled with poisonous spores.

**DEATH PATH 1**: Your lungs burn as the poison overtakes you. Your adventure ends here. (DEATH)

## Branch B: Right Corridor

The strange markings on the walls appear to be an ancient script. As you move deeper, you notice the markings begin to glow faintly.

### Choice B1: What do you do?
- **Touch the glowing markings**: The wall shifts and reveals a hidden passage (Branch B1)
- **Continue without touching anything**: You keep moving forward cautiously (Branch B2)

## Branch B1: Hidden Passage

The passage leads to a small library filled with ancient tomes. One book on a pedestal catches your eye.

### Choice B1-1: Do you read the book?
- **Read the book**: You discover it contains spells for dragon control (LEADS TO BOSS PATH 3)
- **Ignore the book**: You notice another door at the back of the library (Branch B1-2)

## Branch B1-2: The Escape Route

You discover a tunnel that appears to lead out of the dungeon.

**NO BOSS ENDING 1**: You choose survival over glory and escape the dungeon without confronting the dragon. Perhaps another adventurer will slay the beast. (ENDING WITHOUT BOSS)

## Branch B2: The Guardian

Continuing down the corridor, you encounter a stone golem blocking your path.

### Choice B2-1: How do you proceed?
- **Try to fight the golem**: You raise your sword against the stone creature (Branch B2-2)
- **Try to sneak around**: You notice a small gap behind the golem (LEADS TO BOSS PATH 4)

## Branch B2-2: The Golem's Challenge

The golem doesn't attack but instead poses a riddle. Answer correctly, and it will let you pass.

### Choice B2-2-1: Do you:
- **Answer the riddle**: Your answer is correct, and the golem steps aside (LEADS TO BOSS PATH 5)
- **Attack instead of answering**: The golem is too powerful for your weapons

**DEATH PATH 2**: The golem crushes you with its massive stone fist. Your adventure ends here. (DEATH)

## Branch C: Central Staircase

The staircase descends deep into the earth. The air grows warmer as you continue downward.

### Choice C1: At the bottom, you find:
- **A massive iron door**: It seems to lead directly to the dragon's lair (Branch C1)
- **A side passage**: A smaller tunnel branching off to the side (Branch C2)

## Branch C1: The Iron Door

The door is locked with a complex mechanism.

### Choice C1-1: How do you open it?
- **Force it open**: You use your strength to try and break through (Branch C1-2)
- **Look for the key**: You search the surrounding area (Branch C1-3)

## Branch C1-2: Breaking Through

Your attempt to force the door alerts the dragon to your presence.

**NO BOSS ENDING 2**: The dragon unleashes a stream of fire through the door's small openings. You retreat, badly burned. You escape with your life but fail to confront the beast directly. (ENDING WITHOUT BOSS)

## Branch C1-3: The Hidden Key

You find a key hidden in a nearby torch sconce. The door opens silently to reveal the dragon's lair.

**BOSS PATH 1**: You enter cautiously, shield raised, ready to face the dragon. The massive beast lies atop a mountain of treasure, smoke curling from its nostrils. It opens one eye and regards you with ancient malice.

## Branch C2: The Side Passage

The tunnel leads to a strange underground lake. A small boat is tethered to the shore.

### Choice C2-1: Do you:
- **Take the boat**: You row across the dark water (Branch C2-2)
- **Walk around the lake**: You follow a narrow path along the edge (Branch C2-3)

## Branch C2-2: Across the Lake

In the middle of the lake, something massive moves beneath the water. The boat rocks violently.

**BOSS PATH 2**: The "lake" was actually part of the dragon's lair! The dragon rises from the water, wings unfurling. You leap from the boat onto a rocky outcropping, drawing your sword as the dragon roars.

## Branch C2-3: The Lake Path

Following the edge of the lake, you discover a dragon scale glimmering on the ground. It's warm to the touch.

**BOSS PATH 3**: As you pick up the scale, you hear a thunderous roar. The dragon has sensed your presence. It crashes through a nearby wall, blocking your path. There's nowhere to run - you must fight!

## BOSS PATH 4: The Sneak Attack

Using the small gap behind the golem, you slip into a massive cavern filled with treasure. The dragon lies sleeping on a mound of gold. You have the element of surprise.

## BOSS PATH 5: The Magical Approach

With the knowledge gained from answering the golem's riddle, you find yourself in a chamber with magical sigils on the floor. Stepping on them in the correct order, a portal opens, leading directly to a ledge overlooking the dragon's lair. The element of surprise is yours, but so is the danger of falling.

## The Dragon Battle

The magnificent beast towers before you, scales gleaming like rubies in the torchlight. Its eyes reflect ancient wisdom and terrible power. How you approach this final confrontation depends on which path you took to reach here, what items you collected, and what knowledge you gained.

Will you slay the dragon and claim its treasure? Or will you fall like so many before you?
